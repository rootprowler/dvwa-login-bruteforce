# üõ°Ô∏è DVWA Login Brute-Force Attack | Hydra Automation

A beginner-level offensive security project that simulates a real-world credential brute-force attack against the login page of DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application), hosted on Metasploitable 2. The project also includes a client-style penetration test report and an automated Python script for executing Hydra attacks.

## üß™ Attack Methodology

1. Scanned the network using `nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24` to find the Metasploitable IP.
2. Identified DVWA running at `http://192.168.254.130/dvwa/login.php`.
3. Used Hydra with custom wordlists to launch a POST-based brute-force.
4. Valid credentials (`admin:password`) were successfully discovered.
5. Automated the process with a Python script.
6. Documented everything in a client-style report.
