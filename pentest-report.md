# Penetration Test Report: DVWA Login Brute-Force

**Client**: Acme Corp *(Internal Lab Simulation)*  
**Test Date**: April 22, 2025  
**Tester**: RedTeamLabs (YourName)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

During a simulated internal penetration test, a brute-force attack was conducted on a vulnerable web application (DVWA). Using Hydra and a custom wordlist, valid login credentials were successfully discovered, highlighting weak password policy enforcement.

---

## 2. Scope

- **Target**: DVWA hosted on internal VM (`192.168.254.130`)
- **Test Type**: Credential brute-force (black-box)
- **Tool Used**: Hydra

---

## 3. Methodology

1. Identified login form endpoint at `/dvwa/login.php`
2. Created custom user and password wordlists
3. Executed brute-force with Hydra using POST form parameters
4. Interpreted success and failure responses to extract valid credentials

---

## 4. Findings

### Vulnerability: Weak Login Authentication

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Description**: The login form lacks brute-force protection (rate limiting, CAPTCHA, account lockout)
- **Successful Credentials**:  
  - `admin : password`

---

## 5. Recommendations

- Implement account lockouts or delays after multiple failed login attempts
- Enforce stronger password policies
- Use multi-factor authentication

---

## 6. Proof of Concept

### Hydra Command:
```bash
hydra -L wordlists/users.txt -P wordlists/passwords.txt 192.168.56.101 http-post-form "/dvwa/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:Login failed"
